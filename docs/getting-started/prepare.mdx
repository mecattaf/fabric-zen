Before diving into Fabric, take a moment to get familiar with a few key concepts and tools.

## Python

Fabric is a powerful and sophisticated Python library. To fully unlock its potential, it's important to have a solid understanding of Python fundamentals. Below are some core concepts you should be familiar with:

- **Packages**: Installing packages with `pip` and managing virtual environments
- **Variables & Data Types**
- **Functions**: Using both `def` and `lambda` functions
- **Conditionals**
- **Loops**: Including `for`- and `while`-loops
- **Exception Handling**: Understanding `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes and objects
